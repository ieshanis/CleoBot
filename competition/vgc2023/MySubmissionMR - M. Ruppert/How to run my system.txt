Hello thanks in advance for running this competition 


My Competition and my remote competitor dont need any changes. The important part 
is that MyBattlePolicy gets imported in the Competitior part. To do so you can copy the battlePolicy "KidMeBot" into your BattlePolicy file. 
That file needs to be imported in my "MyCompetitor". Its important that the paths are the same as in the git project. then this line should work: 
"from vgc.behaviour.BattlePolicies import KidMeBot". 

The MyCompetitorMR file needs to be in the agent folder, cause i import it in the MyRemoteCompetitorMR from there with this line: "from agent.MyCompetitorMR import KidMeCompetitor"

That should be everything to include my RemoteCompetitor 

Best regards 
Martin
